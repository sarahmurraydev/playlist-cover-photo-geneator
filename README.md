## Idea:
Have spotify autogenerate a profile photo based on the songs added (like it currently does), but this time it keeps scaling the photos so that it's always a n x n (square) cover photo

## NEED: 
1) Create a photo editor that takes in an array of 2n photos and outputs a n by n cover photo. 
2) Ability to connect to spotify 



## Development: 

### Latest status of the code: 

We have been able generate a photo that is a merge of two photos: 
![image](test-images/testMerge2&3.jpeg)

Add now with the latest commit, we ensure images are the same size before merging: 
![image](test-images/testMerge2&3-make-images-same-size.jpeg)

### Next step: 
Try a bunch more photos!
