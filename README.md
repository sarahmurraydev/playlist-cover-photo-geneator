## Idea:
Have spotify autogenerate a profile photo based on the songs added (like it currently does), but this time it keeps scaling the photos so that it's always a n x n (square) cover photo

## NEED: 
1) Create a photo editor that takes in an array of 2n photos and outputs a n by n cover photo. 
2) Ability to connect to spotify
